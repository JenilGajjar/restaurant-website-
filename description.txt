My name is jenil gajjar.
I choose this specific logo beacause of its color and its symbol.
But the main reason why i choose this logo is that the symobl looks like two almonds and it reminds me of the symbol of karate (taijitu).
Taijitu is a special symbol that shows the balance between evil and good or balance between life that indicates that our food is perfectly balanced.
